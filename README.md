In this paper, we propose a stable dishware grasp synthesis method for table bussing robots. In order to generate safe grasp candidates that do not collide with other dishware on the table. We first employ Contact-GraspNet using 3D point cloud data, which is one of effective grasp selection methods. The grasp candidates are then filtered and refined to obtain the final grasp information, which helps the robot gripper lift the dishes straight up without spilling any leftover food. In addition, it is implemented and verified in a simulation environment using Isaac Sim, and can be easily considered in the design stage of table bussing robots.
